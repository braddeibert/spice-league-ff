			<h1>Constitution ðŸ“œ</h1>

			<h2>Format</h2>
			<p>The Spice League follows a redraft format, meaning that each team drafts an entirely new team each year.</p>

			<h2>Draft</h2>
			<p>All team managers will have the opportunity to draft their own team. Auto-draft is not an issue, and allowed for all who choose to do so (or can't participate on draft day). Draft order is picked at random each year, and the format is a "snake" draft (meaning 12th pick in 1st rd. gets 1st pick in 2nd rd.). </p>

			<h2>Trades</h2>
			<p>The league will allow trades amongst league members up until the trade deadline. When 2 teams agree on a trade, it will be subject to vote by the league for confirmation or veto. All votes should be cast in the fantasy app used by the league for that year.</p> 
			<p><strong>Once your vote has been cast, it may not be changed under any circumstances. This is a zero tolerance policy - please be certain of your vote before it is cast.</strong> Reminder: the commissioner reserves the right to reverse any trade at any time by their sole discretion (see "Commissioner's Privilege").</p>

			<h2>Playoffs</h2>
			<p>The top 6 teams by regular season record will be entered into the playoff bracket. The top 2 teams by regular season record will receive a first-round bye. Any tiebreakers in the case of identical win-loss records will be determined by total points scored for each team. </p>

			<h2>Losers Bracket</h2>
			<p>The bottom 6 teams will be entered into the losers bracket. The worst 2 teams by regular season record will receive a first-round bye. Unlike than the regular playoff bracket, a loss in this bracket advances you to the next round. At the end, one team will have lost their way out and will become subject to the last place punishment.</p>

			<h2>Last Place Punishment</h2>
			<p>As explained above, the Spice League requires a punishment to be completed by the last place team's manager each season. Each year, the punishment should be agreed upon by league members by way of vote. It must be a "spicy food challenge" (hence the league name).</p>
			<p>The punishment must be completed by the last place team before buy-ins are collected for the following season. <strong>Failure to do so will result in the league member forfeiting their league spot for the following year.</strong></p>

			<h2>Tiebreakers</h2>
			<p>In the event of a tie (ex. same regular season records for playoff seeding, etc.), the team with the higher total points scored for the season will be concluded the winner.</p>

			<h2>Financials</h2>
			<p>All league buy-ins must be collected by the agreed upon deadline - this is considered your ticket to play for the season. Additionally, the cost to conduct the Last Place Punishment will be split evenly amongst all league members. Please pay these dues directly to the commissioner on Venmo or Cash App.</p>
			<p>Pay-outs will be sent to the winner(s) shortly after the conclusion of the season's final games (~about 1 week).</p>

			<h2>Delinquency & Fines</h2>
			<p><strong>Unset lineups</strong> - League members who fail to set their lineups during the season will be subject to fines as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>1st offense - $5</li>
					<li>2nd offense - $25</li>
					<li>3rd offense - forfeit league spot for following year</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>All fines are payable directly to the commissioner via Venmo or Cash App. All fines will be added into the season's winnings pot. </p>

			<h2>Commissioner's Privilege</h2>
			<p>Everything in this handbook is subject to change and override as found necessary by the Commissioner.</p>
