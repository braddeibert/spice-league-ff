			<h1>About üßê</h1>
			<h2>The League</h2>
			<p>The Spice League is an assembly of close friends & football fans that convene every year for a fantasy football competition. Though the league has been around for several years, it experienced a recent leadership change when Brad Deibert was appointed commissioner by the league.</p>

			<h2>Past Winners</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>2023-24 Quentin Foust</strong> (record: 11-3, 1st round: Derrick Henry)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Your Commissioner</h2>
			<p>Oftentimes affectionately referred to as "my commish" by league members, Brad has served as full time commissioner of the Spice League since taking over in 2023. He loves all things fantasy football, the Green Bay Packers, and especially grown men acting their age when it comes to their made up fantasy team. He lives in Missoula, MT with his wife, Alicia and pathetic/needy housecat, Dorothy.</p>
